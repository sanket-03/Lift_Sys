# Lift_Sys
This is a small attempt to create an algorithm for common escalators. I have used Python to type down the code. There is a lot more scope of improvement into this for example, a specialised greedy approach could be used to update the current approach, also it could be made a real-time working algorithm. So there is lot more to go !! Feel free to make this code more beautiful  :)
